The enclosed R.file demonstrates the implementation of the PDR method for selecting the important tailoring variables and estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimens. Here we present a sample code.

The R.file ‘gen_binary.R’ is used to generate the simulated data, where all the notations of the outputs follow the ones in the main paper. The fitting procedure can be found in R.file 'pdr.R'. Required package: glmnet and drgee.
